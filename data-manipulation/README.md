# Data Manipulation
In this exercise, we'll learn about manipulating data in ways
that are concise and clean. We'll run this code in Node.js,
for simplicity. (It's way easier for me to set up the tests
to run in Node.js as opposed to running in a browser.) That
also means that we'll be able to use modern ES6
features, instead of having to support many browsers.

You will fill in the functions, and run `npm test` to see the tests
pass. If the tests pass, then you can consider the problem complete.
Initially, all tests will fail, and as you fill in the funtions,
you'll see them turn green as they pass.

## Usage

On the command line, execute the following to get the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

On the command line, execute the following to run the tests:

```
npm test
```
