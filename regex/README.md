# Regular Expressions

![xkcd #208](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/regular_expressions.png)

In this section, we will be learning about regular expressions (often abbreviated RegEx). Regular Expressions are a way of determining if strings match a given pattern. This is useful for things like validation (eg "did the user really enter a valid phone number?") or destructing a string (eg "extract the area code from this phone number").

There's nothing that a RegEx can do that you can't do yourself with 10x or 100x more lines of JS. But it's worth it to learn!

> There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.

Start by reading through the resources listed below. (Read at least the begining of the Eloquent JS chapter.) Then, complete the exercises in `index.js`. Write unit tests for each problem in `test.js`. The testing framework has already been set up. Additionally, [`jshint`](http://npmjs.com/package/jshint) has been added to the test step. It will check your code for common errors. You can learn more about jshint on its [official website](http://jshint.com/about/) or the [docs](http://jshint.com/docs/).

## Getting started

Install dependencies:
```
$ npm install
```

Run the tests:
```
$ npm test
```
